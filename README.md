# INTRODUCTION

# Our team Abetra has selected the Machine Learning Problem Statement 1 
# We have used 'chatbot.com' to create a COVIHELP chat bot.
# It helps the users to know what risk they have in getting infected.
# During the pandemic times, the general public do not have much knowledge about the symptoms. The fear in them , make them think that even a harmless cough might be Covid.
# Our bot helps to rule out these confusions.
# It is very user friendly and easy to use.

# Proposed Method

# The code is in Java . 
# We have collected data of the user's name followed by their age and most importantly their vaccination status.
# The users are expected to type these details.
# We have also collected data on the symptoms of COVID 19.
# The bot analyzes these details and tells whether the user's risk of being infected by COVID.
# if Vaccination status is 'yes' and if the user has more than 5 symptoms :- the bot will display that the user is in low risk and it will advise the user to get themselves tested in the nearest hospital.
# if Vaccination status is 'yes' and if the user has less than 5 symptoms :- the bot will display that the user does not have risk of being infected and advise the user to stay at home.
# if Vaccination status is 'no' and if the user has more than 5 symptoms :- the bot will display that the user is in high reisk and it will advise the user to get themselves tested in the nearest hospital and also get vaccianted as soon as possible.
# if Vaccination status is 'no' and if the user has less than 5 symptoms :- the bot will display that the user does not have risk of being infected as of now and advise the user to stay at home. It will suggest them to get vaccinated as soon as possible
# It gives the links of 'WHO' ,'AROGYA SETHU' and 'COWIN'  , which will be useful for the users.

# WORK DONE AND RESULT

# We as a team were able to learn about how bots work . 
# The chat bot with the reply of just yes or no tells you
# 1.Whether you are at LOW/HIGH risk
# 2.Whether you need take the covid test or not 
# 3.whether you need hospitalization  
# 4.Provides a bunch of very useful web resources to guide them even better and to get the best analysis

# Pre requisite questions are asked accordingly.


# CONCLUSION

# We would like to summarize that
# Our team with our chatbot COVIHELP want to facilitate proper doubt clearance and analysis during these tough times.
# with a simple question answer with our bot we will be able to clear the doubts within minutes.
# To do our bit ,we have created this which can be very easily adopted in websites and takes very less space.
# The chatbot thus is a friend of all who is always there to clear your doubts
